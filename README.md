# Analyzing Loan Data from Prosper
_Prosper was kind enough to give us some data, so I went exploring._

# Project Overview

Prosper Marketplace, Inc. is a San Francisco, California-based company in the peer-to-peer lending industry. Prosper Marketplace is America's first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, with over \$7 billion in funded loans.

This project analyzes about 114,000 observations and 12 of the 81 variables in this data set. The data set contains information of about 114,000 individuals (anonymized, of course) across 81 parameters. 

There are three major sections in this project, each providing a piece for the final assessment. These sections are - Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis and Multivariate Analysis. At the end, the final summary explains the results of our analyses.
